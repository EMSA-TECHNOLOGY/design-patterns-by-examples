## Javascript example:

## Benefits
Allow adding or deleting a feature of an object at run-time

## When
- When you want to add new features to objects without affecting these objects.
- When it is impossible to extend an object by inheritance. For example, a class that uses final keywords.
- In many cases the use of inheritance will take a lot of effort in writing code

## Compare Decorator and Adapter
- Decorator tends to operate on an object. Adapter tends to operate on multiple objects (can wrap multiple interfaces)
